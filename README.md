Imagine a situation when someone wants to organize a lecture in Zoom. Firstly, he creates a meeting in Zoom. Then he writes to some groups about that lecture or sends invitations on emails.

### Technologies we used
* Kotlin Android
* Kotlin HttpURLConnection
* Python 3 http.server
* Python 3 sqlite3
* Zoom API
* Google API
